Use "Config.txt" for editing a fractal.
scale - scale of view. Number shows pixels in unit. Recomended value - 150
pattern - pattern of fractal. values:
* Mandelbrot set: MandelbrotSet(steps, exponent=2)
f = z^2 + z0
* Julia set: JuliaSet(steps, a, b, exponent=2) 
f(a, b) = a(z^2 + b)
steps shows how many iterations will be doing at every point in fractal. More steps => more accuracy and slower program work.
Example:
pattern: MandelbrotSet(20);
pattern: JuliaSet(200, (1.8,0), (0,0.2), 2);

palette - colors of fractal points. values:
* default - using default fractal palette.
* "*.txt" - using custom fractal palette. custom palette file format:
N lines with 3 numbers from 0 to 255. first color shows points that tend to 0, other colors shows how fast points tend to limit (screen border).
Example:
palette: default;
palette: "MyPalette.txt"

framerate-limit - framerate limit for program. 8 fps by default. If you don't want the program waste a lot of resources then you can reduce this limit.
